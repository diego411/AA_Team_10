# AA_Team_10

The github storage is not big enough to save the datasets, so we could not provide them here online.<br>
In order to run the notebooks you have to save three datasets locally into the folder "dataset":
 - the bikeshare dataset as "chicago_2018.csv" 
 - the weather dataset as "weather_hourly_chicago.csv"
 - the station dataset as "Divvy_Bicycle_Stations.csv"

You can download the station dataset [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations/bbyy-e7gq/data).
